          he fall. NKJV" A scripture that teaches me about how I am sustained by
          the grace of God. It is by grace that I'm saved and not by my works or
          self-righteouness.

          "Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
          eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. NKJV" The punishment of sin is
          death. when man sinned, he got separated from God. it is only through
          Christ that we can get close to God. That's why Jesus said He is the
          way truth and life, no one goes to the father except through Him.

          God has love for mankind that is why in other to save us He sent His
          only son to die for our sins. "Rom 10:9 that if you confess with your
          mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him
          from the dead, you will be saved. NKJV" If we confess with our mouth
          the Lord Jesus and believe that Jesus is the son of God and believe he
          died and was raised from the dead, we will be saved. There are two
          acts involved which is confessing outwardly with our mouth and
          believing with our heart. beloved God loves us and He wants a
          relationship with us. Give your life to Jesus, He is the only true
          way!
